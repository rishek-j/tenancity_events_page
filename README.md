# Events-page-webdev-internship-project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

If you don't have node js installed in both the "server" and "eventsPage_ReactApp" directories then first run:

### `npm install`

## In the "eventsPage_ReactApp" directory to install all dependencies run:

### `npm install axios`
We are using axios to connect it to the backend.

### `npm start`
It runs the app in the development mode.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## In <b>"server"</b> directory to install all dependencies run:

### `npm install MongoDB nodemon cors express mongoose`
